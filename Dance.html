<p><font face="calibri"><h2>Definiton</h2></p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> Dance is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself. </p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> At the beggining dance was used as a method of religius practices in different cultures, but with the pass of the year dance has been defined firstly as an elegant, and regular movement, harmoniously composed of beautiful Attitudes, and contrasted graceful Posture of the Body, and parts thereof, also emphasized the qualities of grace, harmony, and beauty, distinguishing “true” dance from the supposedly crude and spontaneous movements of early man by the masters and historians of the 18th and 19th century. But later in the 20th century the critics started to ignored the formal aspect of dance in emphasizing its role as a physical expression of inner emotion.  </p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> Saying this, it is esxpose that ballet was considerated the first type of dance and the first formal court ballet recognized was satged in 1573 with "Ballet des Polonais" in France</p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> With our evolution we have found different ways to practice this art in our own way, we counted with techniques that not everybody can practice (such as ballet, contemporary, folk dance, etc.) and also we have other types of dance that everybody can do, it is more about what kind of dance each is inclined to.  </p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"><h2> Everybody can dance?</h2></p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> I wish I could say yes but it is not true, because in a small country called Kuwait in the Persian Gulf, dancing is considered indecency, and there is a law that prohibits people from dancing at concerts, although they can clap to the beat of the music. Doing so could land you in jail.</p></font>


<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"><center>And finally, I want to post this pictures of this dances with that position to show you what is my goal in ballet, what is yours? </center></p></font>
