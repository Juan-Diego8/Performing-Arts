<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"><h2> Definition </h2></p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> A performance is an Avant-garde show in which elements from various arts and fields are combined, such as music, dance, theater and plastic arts. has its origins in Futurism and Dadaism but it became a major phenomenon in the 60s and 70s and can be seen as a branch of Conceptual Art. </p></font>



<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> It is characterized by the combnation between extravangance, questioning, abstract and for leaving more to the viewer to draw their own conclusions. </p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"><h2> What are the difference between performance and theater or dance? </h2></p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> a principal difference I could say that performances are presented mostly in museums than in theaters, addig the participation of the public and a more intimate connection with them.

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"> Personally, I think that this is my less favorite because I see on it a lot of potential that most of the times is wasted for keeping doing extravagant thing and letting the peoples give their own meaning.  </p></font>

<p><font face="calibri" font size="5"><center>But thanks that not everything is bad I will show you one of my favorite performances. Is my fovorite because it treats one of the topics that whole Latin America is related with: the the disappearance of people, showing in the performance that people apparently can end up being disposable, A strong message that has a puspose and the artist know how to explain it to create an impact to the audience.</center></p></font>
